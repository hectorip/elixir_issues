Issues
======

This is the project created in the book "Programming Elixir", as an exercise to
dominate all the concepts.

Specifically we are working with mix and making tests, and using the abilities
in a fully functional project.

This will be a terminal app.

I hope to do more proejects like this, just for fun.
